AAAI-upload code
This project is the code for the signal preprocessing and recognition model mentioned in the paper.
It is divided into two folders: one is the preprocess folder, which includes four python files.
● split.py: A tool for slicing the raw data (time series signals) of distributed optical fiber sensing, dividing time series data into the required length.
● tf_pi.py: Used for batch converting timing signals into time-frequency maps.
● image_joint.py: Information fusion of time-frequency maps of continuous defense zones to generate space-time-frequency maps.
● data enhancement.py:
